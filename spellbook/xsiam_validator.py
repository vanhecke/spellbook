        without a word (content_graph/parsers/script.py), so anything
        Python-only on a prompt validates, uploads, and does nothing.

        The rest are rules nothing in spellbook's chain enforces:

        - DO104 fails every non-JS script without a docker image and says to

        - The strict Script model requires a userprompt, and neither
          demisto-sdk validate nor _check_strict_schemas applies it.
        - The platform drops top-level model and systemprompt on upload, and
          stores promptConfig.model without using it. The model comes from
          promptConfig.modelTier, or the tenant default without one, and the
          system prompt from promptConfig.systemInstruction.
        - The platform rejects a prompt without exactly one output: "'Outputs'
          attribute must have 1 value (52)".
        - AG101 requires marketplaces of exactly [platform], inherited from
          pack_metadata.json when the item sets none. The default config
          does not select AG101.
        - The prompt editor limits ${variable} names and responseJsonSchema.

        every tool in the chain. Validation passes, upload reports success,
        the pack installs and the tenant reports the new version, but the
